/* Private Function Definitions */

/*
Calculate the new position of a ship based on how it is moving, its speed, and
fuel state. This function should be called only if the state is 
MOVING_TO_POSITION or MOVING_ON_COURSE.

Track_base has an update_position(double time) function that computes the new position
of an object after the specified time has elapsed. If the Ship is going to move
for a full time unit (one hour), then it will get go the "full step" distance,
so update_position would be called with time = 1.0. If we can move less than that,
e.g. due to not enough fuel, update position  will be called with the corresponding
time less than 1.0.

For clarity in specifying the computation, this code assumes the specified private variable names, 
but you may change the variable names or enum class names, or state names if you wish (e.g. movement_state).
